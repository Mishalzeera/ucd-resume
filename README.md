## The #UCD ## Project

Code Institutes resume project that gets us learning a bit about UX/UCD, using all kinds of abbreviations and terminology.

On an aside note - and written here strictly for my own amusement - I look forwards to the day when people stop using the word "implement" outside of describing tools commonly used for house maintenance. You only have to add the words "business strategies in todays fast paced global market" to induce an emetic response. Attempt this at your own risk, dear reader.
